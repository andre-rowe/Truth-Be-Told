# ✨ Truth Be Told  (PROTOTYPE AT BOTTOM)
### Reimagining the Volunteer Experience with Empathy and Clarity

> A civic UX case study focused on improving the onboarding experience for volunteers supporting incarcerated women.

---

## 🔍 Overview

**Truth Be Told** is a nonprofit dedicated to empowering incarcerated women through storytelling, connection, and community. Their volunteer program is a vital part of that mission — but the digital experience left volunteers feeling uncertain, disconnected, and unsupported.

Our UX team reimagined the volunteer journey from the ground up: making it clearer, warmer, and more empowering for first-time and returning volunteers alike.

## 🧰 Tools Used

## 🧠 Research Insights

> “I filled out the form, but didn’t hear back… I wasn’t sure if I was even needed.”

Through interviews and surveys, we discovered key friction points:
- Lack of confirmation or next steps post-signup
- No clear contact point or role expectations
- Low social proof (no testimonials, unclear impact)
- High emotional motivation, but low informational clarity

---

## 📌 Persona & Journey

We created **Marcia**, a first-time volunteer persona, to represent our research findings.  
Her journey included:
- Feeling confused about what she was signing up for
- A lack of direction during onboarding
- Gaining confidence after seeing testimonials and step-by-step flow

---

## 💡 Design Goals

- Help users feel **confident and informed** about joining
- Build **trust** through transparency and visuals
- Create an experience that feels **warm, structured, and human**

---

## 🧪 Prototyping & Testing

**Key Features:**
- Step-by-step onboarding with CTAs
- Volunteer testimonials and role previews
- Confirmation screens and visible progress indicators
- Friendly tone and welcoming imagery

We tested our high-fidelity prototype with 5 volunteers.
